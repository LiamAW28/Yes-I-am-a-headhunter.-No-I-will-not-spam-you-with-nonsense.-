# Yes-I-am-a-headhunter.-No-I-will-not-spam-you-with-nonsense.-


A little bit about me. I am a relentless ðŸ¦„ hunter and talent thief ðŸ•µ. I specialise in tracking down highly talented Front-end & Full Stack Developers/Engineers around the UK, broadening their opportunities moving forward and then placing them into their dream role. If you are open to new opportunities or are looking for an exploratory conversation, in or out of core working hours, feel free to reach out to me on lwilson@providepeople.com. Conversations are all confidential.
